# nodejs-file-upload-and-csv-parse

This project deploys express framework and fast-csv module to fulfil the function of file upload and cvs file parsing. Testing is based on a shopping list csv file provided by the vendor, and I have also provided a functionality to submit a pure shopping form.

## shopping form

 1. display a tax percentage under the category.
 2. choose the count between 0 and 10000.
 3. pop up a confirm dialog before submit the form

##file upload
1. file extension validation : only for csv file recently
2. file size validation : should not greater than 1M
